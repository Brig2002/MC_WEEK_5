## How I set up my Arbitrum environment
- First of all I log into my Metamask.
- Secondly click an arrow at the side of the Ethereum Mainnet.
- Then it drop down and I click on Add network to add the necessary addresses and requirements.

## How I wrote and deployed my contract 
- I then wrote my  license and my pragma version.
- I then wrote my contract.
- I learn how to structure your contracts using imports.
- I use the Factory Pattern to deploy and manage multiple instances of the SimpleStorage contract.
- I then create a function to deploy contracts and store them in an array.
- I build an AdvancedStorage contract that inherits from SimpleStorage and adds new features.
- I practice extending functions using the virtual and override keywords.
- I create a contract that inherits from two parent contracts with conflicting functions.
- I then resolve the conflict explicitly using the override keyword.




## The challenges I faced
- I faced a challenge with sending the Arbitrum test token to my metamask.
