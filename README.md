## How I set up my Arbitrum environment
- First of all I log into my Metamask.
- Secondly click an arrow at the side of the Ethereum Mainnet.
- Then it drop down and I click on Add network to add the necessary addresses and requirements.

## How I wrote and deployed my contract 
- I then wrote my  license and my pragma version.
- I then wrote my contract.
- I created the constructor which initialize the contract with a message.
- I also wrote an updateMassage function which helps as to update the message in the constructor.
- I then compiled and deployed the contract on the Arbitrum testnet.

## The challenges I faced
- I faced a challenge with sending the Arbitrum test token to my metamask.
